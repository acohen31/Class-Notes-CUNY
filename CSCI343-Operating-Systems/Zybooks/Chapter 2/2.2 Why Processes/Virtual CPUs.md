- Structuring an app as processes allows independence from the:
	- Number of CPUs: A physical CPU is a real hardware instance of a CPU. Multiple processes may run on one physical CPU using a technique known as time sharing. Each process is given a virtual CPU: A CPU that the process assumes is available only to itself.
	- Type of CPU: A virtual CPU can be just an abstraction of the physical CPU or it can be software that emulates the behavior of a different CPU.

# Benefits
- Multi-user support:
	- Users can share a machine while being invisible to each other
- Multi-CPU transparency: 
	- An application written to utilize multiple CPUs will run correctly, although perhaps more slowly, if only one CPU is available.
- Portability: 
	- An application compiled for one type of CPU can run on a different CPU without being modified or even recompiled.
