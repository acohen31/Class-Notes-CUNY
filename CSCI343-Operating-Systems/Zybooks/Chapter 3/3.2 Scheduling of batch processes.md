### Batch Process
- A batch process performs a long-running and generally repetitive task that does not require any intervention from the user. Ex: Payroll, insurance claims processing, weather prediction, scientific calculations.
### FIFO scheduling algorithm 
- also known as first-come-first-served (FCFS)
- Schedules strictly by process arrival time
- Earlier arrival = higher priority
- Theoretically arbitration rule picks process at random when arrival time is the same
- But in reality requests processed sequentially and therefore they have different arrival times

	1. Three processes need to be scheduled. p1 arrives at t = 0 and will need 6 units of CPU time. p2 arrives at t = 1 and will need 3 units. p3 arrives at t = 3 and will need 2 units.
	2. p1 arrived first and starts immediately at t = 0.
	3. p2 arrived second and will start as soon as p1 terminates at t = 6.
	4. p3 is the last arriving process and will start when p2 terminates at t = 9.
### SJF scheduling algorithm
- Also known as Shortest Job Next (SJN)
- Schedules p's by total CPU time requirement
- Higher prio goes to shorter CPU time
- Arbitration rule used based on arrival times if multiple p's have same time requirement

	2. p1 arrived first and starts immediately at t = 0.
	3. p3 has a shorter total CPU time requirement than p2 and will start as soon as p1 terminates at t = 6.
	4. p2 starts when p3 terminates at t = 8.
### SRT scheduling algorithm
- Shortest Remaining Time
- schedules p's by remaining CPU time needed to complete work
- Higher prio to shorter remaining CPU time
- Arbitration based on arrival time
- **NOTE** SRT is the preemptive version of SJF

	1. Three processes need to be scheduled. p1 arrives at t = 0 and will need 6 units of CPU time. p2 arrives at t = 1 and will need 3 units. p3 arrives at t = 3 and will need 2 units.
	2. p1 arrives first and starts immediately at t = 0.
	3. p2 arrives at t = 1. p2's remaining time is 3 units while p1's remaining time is 5 units. Thus p2 preempts p1 and starts at t = 1.
	4. p3 arrives at t = 3. p3's remaining time is 2 units while p2's remaining time is only 1 unit. Thus p2 continues running until t = 4.
	5. At t = 4, p1's remaining time is 5 units and p3's remaining time is 2 units. Thus p3 starts and runs until t = 6.
	6. Finally, p1 restarts at t = 6 and terminates at t = 11.
### Estimating total CPU time
#### Long-term Scheduling
- Estimated from previous runs of same program or supplied by programmer
#### Short-term Scheduling
- Total CPU time AKA **CPU BURST** changes for each arrival/departure period
- Estimated by **EXPONENTIAL AVERAGING**
	- combines last estimate of total CPU time (Sn) with last actually observed total CPU time (Tn) to predict the next total CPU time (Sn+1)
