### Batch Process
- A batch process performs a long-running and generally repetitive task that does not require any intervention from the user. Ex: Payroll, insurance claims processing, weather prediction, scientific calculations.
### FIFO scheduling algorithm 
- also known as first-come-first-served (FCFS)
- Schedules strictly by process arrival time
- Earlier arrival = higher priority
- Theoretically arbitration rule picks process at random when arrival time is the same
- But in reality requests processed sequentially and therefore they have different arrival times

	1. Three processes need to be scheduled. p1 arrives at t = 0 and will need 6 units of CPU time. p2 arrives at t = 1 and will need 3 units. p3 arrives at t = 3 and will need 2 units.
	2. p1 arrived first and starts immediately at t = 0.
	3. p2 arrived second and will start as soon as p1 terminates at t = 6.
	4. p3 is the last arriving process and will start when p2 terminates at t = 9.
### SJF scheduling algorithm
- Also known as Shortest Job Next (SJN)
- Schedules p's by total CPU time requirement
- Higher prio goes to shorter CPU time
- Arbitration rule used based on arrival times if multiple p's have same time requirement

	2. p1 arrived first and starts immediately at t = 0.
	3. p3 has a shorter total CPU time requirement than p2 and will start as soon as p1 terminates at t = 6.
	4. p2 starts when p3 terminates at t = 8.
### SRT scheduling algorithm
- Shortest Remaining Time
- schedules p's by remaining CPU time needed to complete work
- Higher prio to shorter remaining CPU time
- Arbitration based on arrival time
- **NOTE** SRT is the preemptive version of SJF

	1. Three processes need to be scheduled. p1 arrives at t = 0 and will need 6 units of CPU time. p2 arrives at t = 1 and will need 3 units. p3 arrives at t = 3 and will need 2 units.
	2. p1 arrives first and starts immediately at t = 0.
	3. p2 arrives at t = 1. p2's remaining time is 3 units while p1's remaining time is 5 units. Thus p2 preempts p1 and starts at t = 1.
	4. p3 arrives at t = 3. p3's remaining time is 2 units while p2's remaining time is only 1 unit. Thus p2 continues running until t = 4.
	5. At t = 4, p1's remaining time is 5 units and p3's remaining time is 2 units. Thus p3 starts and runs until t = 6.
	6. Finally, p1 restarts at t = 6 and terminates at t = 11.
### Estimating total CPU time
#### Long-term Scheduling
- Estimated from previous runs of same program or supplied by programmer
#### Short-term Scheduling
- Total CPU time AKA **CPU BURST** changes for each arrival/departure period
- Estimated by **EXPONENTIAL AVERAGING**
	- combines last estimate of total CPU time (Sn) with last actually observed total CPU time (Tn) to predict the next total CPU time (Sn+1)

### Performance of the algorithms
- whole point of batch processes is to maximize number of processes completed per unit of time
- **TURNAROUND TIME** of a process is the time between arrival and departure and sum of total CPU time and waiting time
- **AVERAGE TURN AROUND TIME (ATT)** for n p's is the mean of n turn around times
- Important to guarantee fairness
	- **STARVATION** is indefinite postponement of p while other p's can proceed
		- **IMPORTANT** SJF and SRT can lead to starvation

	1. p1 arrives at time 0 and will need 6 units of CPU time. p2 arrives at time 1 and will need 3 units of CPU time. p3 arrives at time 3 and will need 2 units of CPU time.
	2. Under FIFO, all processes start and terminate in the order of arrival.
	3. p1 starts with 0 waiting time and runs for 6 units. p2 waits for 5 units and runs for 3 units. p3 waits for 6 units and runs for 2 units. Average turnaround time = 7.33.
	4. Under SJF, p1 starts since no other process has arrived yet. p3 is shorter than p2 and thus runs before p2.
	5. The turnaround time for p1 is 6 under SJF. But p3 waits 3 units less while p2 waits only 2 units more. The ATT is reduced to 7.
	6. The arrival of new processes of length less than 3 (the length of p2) prior to time 8 could lead to an indefinite postponement (starvation) of p2.
	7. Under SRT, p1 is interrupted by p2 and both p2 and p3 complete before p1 resumes.
	8. Compared to SJF, p2's waiting time is reduced by 7 and p3's waiting time is reduced by 2. p1's waiting time is increased by only 5, which reduces the ATT to 5.66.
	9. The arrival of new processes of length less than 5 (the remainder of p1) prior to time 6 could lead to an indefinite postponement (starvation) of p1.
