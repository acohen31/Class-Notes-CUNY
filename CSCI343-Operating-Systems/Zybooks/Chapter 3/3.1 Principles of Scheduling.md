### Long-term vs short-term scheduling
- **Long-term scheduling** 
	- decides when a process should enter the ready state and start competing for the CPU.
- **Short-term scheduling** 
	- Moves p's between RL and CPU
- **Long-term scheduling**
	- Decides which new p moves to RL
	- Takes care of suspended p's

	1. Processes are created at unpredictable times and enter the system with the process state: new.
	2. Long-term scheduling decides which processes are moved to the ready list to compete for the CPU.
	3. Processes are also subject to long-term scheduling when suspended and later reactivated by the OS.
	4. Short-term scheduling moves processes between the ready list and the CPU.
	5. When a running process becomes blocked and later reenters the RL, short-term scheduling is again applied to let the process compete for the CPU.
### Preemptive vs non-preemptive scheduling
- **Non-Preemptive**
	- scheduling algorithm allows a running p to continue until the p terminates or blocks
- **Preemptive**
	- scheduling algorithm may stop current p and choose another p to run
		- decision made when:
			- new p enters the RL
			- previously blocked or suspended p re-enters RL
			- OS periodically interrupts the currently running p to give another p a chance to run

### Priority for short-term scheduling
- **Priority of Process**
	- numerical val indicating importance of p relative to other p's
	- can be constant or can change dynamically
- **Arbitration Rule**
	- decides which process should proceed if 2 or more processes have the same prio

### Priority for long-term scheduling
- Based on same parameters as ST scheduling
	- Differences
		-  Arrival is the time of process creation.
		- Departure is the time of process destruction.
- However, LT scheduling occurs much less frequently than ST scheduling and thus decisions made here are broad, focusing on which processes to start or admit for execution over a longer time frame, ensuring the system isn't overloaded and has the resources to manage its workload effectively.

	1. A process goes through a series of state transitions starting from new and ending in terminated.
	2. For short-term scheduling, each arrival is a transition into ready state (entering RL) and each departure is a transition into blocked state (leaving RL).
	3. For long-term scheduling, arrival is the creation of the process (entering new) and departure is the destruction of the process (leaving terminated).
	4. The attained CPU time accumulates between arrival and departure while the process is running.
	5. For short-term scheduling, the attained CPU time restarts with each arrival and keeps accumulating until the current time.
	6. For long-term scheduling, the attained CPU time keeps accumulating since the process's creation until the current time.
	7. The real time for short-term scheduling start with each arrival and accumulates until the current time regardless of the process's state (running or ready).
	8. The real time for long-term scheduling start with the process creation and accumulates until the current time regardless of the process's state (running, ready, or blocked).
	9. The total CPU time is the accumulation of all CPU times (running state) from arrival to departure. For short-term scheduling the accumulation restarts with each new arrival.
	10. Long-term scheduling has only a single arrival. Thus the total CPU time is the accumulation of all CPU times (running states) from process arrival to process termination.
- **IMPORTANT TO NOTE**
	- Arrival
		- For ST Scheduling is a transition into RL from NEW or BLOCKED
		- For LT Scheduling is when p enters NEW
	- Departure
		- For ST Scheduling is a transition into BLOCKED (leaving RL)
		- For LT Scheduling is process destruction (leaving terminated)
